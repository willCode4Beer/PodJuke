<h1>About the App</h1>
<p>
	PodJuke is small application for playing podcasts.
	You can load up several podcasts and have them merged and sorted.
	It features a player queue for the particular tracks that you are interested in.
</p>
<p>
	The app was designed to be used for teaching how to build packaged Chrome Applications
	(notice there is no query string in the address bar).
	If you are interested in this, feel free to visit the project page.
</p>
<p>
	All of the source code is available in GitHub.
	Each step of the tutorial is defined in a different branch.
</p>
<h2>Why is PodJuke So Ugly?</h2>
<p>
	Unfortunately, I'm one of those engineers who completely lack design skills.
	However, if you have suggestions to improve the look and feel please, pass them along.
	I would be more than happy to incorporate your ideas. 
</p>
<p>
	The look and feel is completely handled with CSS. If you feel really motivated,
	grab the code from GitHub and change it up.
</p>
<h2>Resources</h2>
<p>
	PodJuke uses Google's Closure Library and is built using the Closure Compiler.
	In addition to minimizing the size of the package, it helps improve the performance
	of the javascript.
	The minification obfuscates the code by default but, it's not the primary reason for it's use.
